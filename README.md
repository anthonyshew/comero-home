## How It Works
> Just bring Comero you're content and you're done.

We've done all the heavy lifting. Design, development, and customizability. Through the beauty of Netlify CMS, we use GraphQL queries to pipe our client's data into the front-end of their website. This all occurs at build time (thank you, Gatsby) so our site visitors end up with a crazy fast page loading experience.

## Hmm, seems a little too simple?
That's right. **We want it that way.**
Most restaurant owners tell us they aren't looking for much. They just need a display for their hours and their menu. For that reason, we keep the entire site on one easily navigatable page with just the need-to-know information that a restaurant requires.

If our client wants more on their site than that, no problem. Our platform is easily extensible through the beauty of React and Netlify CMS. We can add on more customizable pages and content as desired.
